# nEXO Model Meeting 2

### Updates:
**3D model:**
- Completed
  - Connections implemented between components
  - Channels created for LED wiring
  - Added walkway supports around platform structure
  - Printed a prototype base - tank and floor of tank fit in almost perfectly
  - added channels up the walls for LED wires
- In progress
  - modelling the cave in solidworks
  - prints - have printed cryostat (minus clear TPC), tank floor, outer platform body
- Next steps
  - print water tank, tank floor, cave, cryostat frame, roof, walkway

**Hardware:**
- Completed
  - Decided on LEDs - same colour for walls and floor [https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/5490/16630594?s=N4IgjCBcoLQBxVAYygMwIYBsDOBTANCAPZQDa4ArAEwIC6AvvYVWSBQCwCcADCA0A]
- In progress
  - Designing the HAT - rough plan completed

  - calculting resistor values for LEDs
     - wall and floor LEDs will have same value

- Next steps
  - Printing HAT and soldering components
  - Testing LEDs with Pi - we only tested them with the 3.3V pin
 
**Program:**
- Completed
  - Assigned pins to LEDs (See README.md)
- In Progress
  - have looked at event rates, some events like muons are very common whereas others like Xe 137 are very very rare
  - we will test these real times and if they are not great we will see
  - writing code for rpi to control LEDs
- Next steps
  - writing PWM program to control the intensity of light and change colours in RGB
  - send out email with event rates to circulate for comments

### Discussion:
- going to use VGA 15 pin connector now instead of bulky d sub
- making prototype of circuit
