# First nEXO 3D model meeting:

### Plan: create a mini model of nExo that can be printed
includes water tank, platform, cryopit, cyostat
LED in walls and in TPC that flash with expected rates of data
almost all solidworks files have been completed
water tank printed in shiny filament for stainless steel
bought soluble filament to print platform with, some troubleshooting with the soluble
blue liht in outer detector when muon passes - only coincident event
TPC red for bg event
green for 2nbb
purple for 0nbb assuming 7.4x10^27 year half life

### Next steps:
- connections bw pieces to fit in each other
- testing soluble filament
- add holes for wiring
- test id small pcb is needed, wiring plan
- acquire and simulate data, put it into a ras pi
- aim to have the project finished by the first week of july

### Questions:
- how much real time should correspond to a day of nEXO data taking??? (2min??)
- other events we want to show?
- use SLAC git for ras pi programming
- show a version with increased rates of 0nbb since it is low
- could have a function switch with an interactive touch screen to change the probablities

## Discussion:
updated CAD bc skirt is out of nickel now (no longer electro form copper) (verify with who?)
Brian might take more of an advisory role for ras pi programming
for multi-colour LED, might want to find other LEDs, soldering 4 wires to the SMDs might be tough
circuit can be external, the LEDs will require a driver
probably need a pcb to deal with all the LEDs
make a SLAC in nEXO,
first look at how soldering to the LEDs go, Brian will look at other LEDs
Look-up table easy, less fun, might be interesting to go with a RNG
Sophie will take lead with programming the pi, with Emilio, Kevin to help
Looking for a generic hat, might not need a custom pcb
Tania check the LEDs
Julien to build/look for the hat/pcb
Elliot help with printing
Use McGill's git, invite Brian
Regan and Soud offered to help getting the data
Looking to keep this meeting time
