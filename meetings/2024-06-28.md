# Meeting 3

## 3D Model
- outer cave printed
- printing dome
- added cap to put in the screw terminal for VGA cable
- case for raspberry pi printed
- glued all LEDs into windows and wires on wall and floor
- glued platform and plates together
- paint the lights

### Next steps
- glueing reflective coating
- printing cryostat
- tpc today, tpc cover
- print extra rectangle
- extra pieces: just in case pieces break

## Software
- sophie wrote test code to choose LED colours and for LEDs to flash
- eliot wrote code to add halflives ad the inner 1t and 2t
- issue: when switching between halflives and which volume you want it causes issues due to while true loop
  - maybe add time limit or just stop code
- added GUI to display the colour assignments and options to toggle half lives and volume
- look into displaying a video
- look into other time scales for the muons

### Next steps
- add to git

## Hardware
- soldered 2/3 HATs (tested and circuit works!)
- issue: VGA cable is not 1 to 1

### Next steps
- either make a new VGA cable or order a custom 1 to 1 cable

## Plan for Video
- filming today!!!
- quick explanation of what nEXO is and showcasing the model
- filming group members doing different tasks
- sub teams should write a script saying quick overview of what you did and how it contributes to the model
  - add in the scientific importance
- tentative deadline to film: July 9
